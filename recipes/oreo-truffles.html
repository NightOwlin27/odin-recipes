They're always the first thing to go at parties and I'm yet to meet someone who doesn't love them!</em></p>

            <ul>
                <li>Oreos</li>
                <li>Cream cheese</li>

            <h3>Steps</h3>
            <ol>
                <li><strong>Prepare a baking sheet:</strong> Line an 18 by 13-inch baking sheet with wax paper or parchment paper.</li>
                <li><strong>Crush Oreos:</strong> Place 36 Oreos in a food processor and pulse too fine crumbs. Alternatively this can be done by hand placing Oreos in a gallon size resealable bag and crushing to fine crumbs.</li>
                <li><strong>Mix Oreos with cream cheese:</strong> add cream cheese to food processor, pulse in bursts until mixture is combined.</li>
                <li><strong>Shape mixture into balls:</strong> Scoop mixture out about 1 Tbsp at a time and form into 1 inch balls then align on prepared cookie sheet.</li>
                <li><strong>Chill:</strong> Place truffles in freezer for 15 minutes. Meanwhile crush remaining 3 Oreos.</li>
                <li><strong>Melt Chocolate:</strong> Melt almond bark or chocolate according to directions on package</li>
                <li><strong>Dip truffles:</strong> Remove truffles from freezer and dip in melted chocolate and use a spoon to pour some chocolate over the top then lift and allow excess chocolate to run off.</li>
                <li><strong>Let set:</strong> Return to baking sheet, immediately sprinkle tops with crushed Oreos if desired, then allow chocolate to set. Alternatively, you can drizzle with melted chocolate for a nice finishing touch.</li>
